# Assignment
Building a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer.

# Goal
1. Use the provided word list
2. Load the list and select a word between 5 and 12 characters
3. Display a count or hangman along with the current state of the game.
4. Every turn, the player can guess 1 letter. If you're out of turns, the player should lose. If the word is guessed, the player wins.
5. Implement functionality for saving the state of the game.
6. Add an option to game start to continue the previous game.

# Expectations and challenges
1. Implementing the game functionality seems straightforward.
2. If there will be a hangman, this will be a puzzle ;-)
3. Since this is the first time I will be using serialization and trying to save (the state of) a class, I expect this to be a struggle for a while until it clicks.
4. Restarting the saved game seems trivial once the hurdles from 3. have been overcome.

# Results and Evaluation

# Notes for future revisiting
